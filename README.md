## Grid search

This code conducts a grid search to find the optimal values for b1 and b2, minimizing the total error of a quadratic linear equation within a range of 0.01 steps. Additionally, it generates an error surface plot to visualize the global minima within the specified range of b1 and b2, using given inputs and outputs. (Note: The error surface plot serves as a visual aid to identify the optimal minima, as they have already been estimated.)

## Markov Chain simulation for estimating the value of pi

This Monte Carlo simulation estimates the value of pi by simulating dart throws onto a unit square containing a unit circle. The probability of a dart landing inside the circle is pi/4, and pi can be approximated as 4 times this probability. The graph illustrates the estimated value of pi based on the total number of darts thrown onto the unit square.

\(P(\text{darts falling into unit circle}) = \frac{\text{number of darts inside the unit circle}}{\text{Total number of darts}} = \frac{\text{area}(unit circle)}{\text{area}(square)} = \frac{\pi \cdot \left(\frac{a^2}{2}\right)}{a^2} = \frac{\pi}{4}\)

Hence, \( \pi = P(\text{darts falling into the unit circle}) \times 4 \)

Where \( \pi_{\text{cap}} = \left(\frac{\text{number of darts inside the unit circle}}{\text{Total number of darts}}\right) \times 4 \)

This \( \pi_{\text{cap}} \) serves as the estimated value of pi, which may vary with different total numbers of darts.

### Utilizing uniform random samples

Random values, representing where the darts land on the unit square, are generated by sampling from a uniform distribution. This randomness enables the darts to land anywhere on the unit square, facilitating faster convergence of the estimated value of pi.

### Utilizing random samples from a normal distribution

Random values, determining the dart landing points on the unit square, are obtained by sampling from a normal distribution. This method yields randomized values, potentially centered on the unit circle if the standard deviation is 1. Increasing the standard deviation broadens the distribution, allowing points to fall across the unit circle and aiding in the convergence of \( \pi_{\text{cap}} \).

## Random Sampler

This program constructs a random sampler utilizing distributions with varying probability mass functions. While this may introduce weighting towards certain features during random sampling, calculating the cumulative mass function for each feature can ensure randomness and mitigate bias
